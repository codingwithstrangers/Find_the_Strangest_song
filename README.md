Symphony Project Design Document
Client Information:
•	Client: Works for YouTube (contract through a third party).
•	Industry: Music business.
•	Requirement: Integrate YouTube's music algorithm into a project.
________________________________________
Project Overview:
Phase 1: API Access
•	Spotify API: Reference for API call structure (setup complete).
•	YouTube Advanced API: Need access via client's connections.
•	YouTube Basic API: If sufficient, implement using .get in Python.
Phase 2: Algorithm and Features
•	Objective: Develop an algorithm for music suggestions based on user emotions.
o	Suggestions for three emotions: Happy, Sad, Excited.
o	Use a scale of 0-10 to quantify and make music suggestions.
•	Web Interface:
o	Scalable design using React and server-based studies.
o	Potential feature: Voice pitch analysis to detect user emotion.
•	Database: Create a relational database for storing and accessing data.

Technical Requirements:
Programming Languages:
•	Backend: Python.
•	Frontend: JavaScript (React), HTML, CSS.
Database Options:
•	SQLite: Lightweight option.
•	JSON: Suitable for testing phase.
•	SQL: Preferred for production backend.
Hosting Options:
•	Replit: For initial testing (like CodePen).
•	AWS Free Tier: 12-month free usage (client funding required after free period).
•	Docker: Research and consider for deployment.
Development Environment:
•	IDE: Visual Studio.
________________________________________
Implementation Details:
Client Information and Privacy:
•	NDA: Client NDA with YouTube cleared on 07/22/2024.
•	Privacy: All client information to be anonymized for public streaming.
Streaming and Testing Platforms:
•	Platforms: Twitch, GitHub, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and other approved Coding with Strangers platforms.
•	Testing: Use free web hosting sites to gather audience feedback.

Execution Plan:
1.	Setup Development Environment:
o	Configure Visual Studio for Python and React development.
o	Set up initial database structure using SQLite or JSON for testing.
2.	API Integration:
o	Integrate Spotify API for reference.
o	Obtain access to YouTube Advanced API and integrate.
o	Develop functions to pull data using YouTube Basic API if Advanced API is not available.
3.	Algorithm Development:
o	Design and implement the music suggestion algorithm.
o	Define parameters for happy, sad, and excited music suggestions.
4.	Web Interface:
o	Develop a scalable web interface using React.
o	Implement voice pitch analysis feature (optional).
5.	Database and Hosting:
o	Finalize database structure using SQL for production.
o	Choose appropriate hosting solution and deploy.
6.	Testing and Deployment:
o	Conduct initial tests using Replit or other free hosting platforms.
o	Gather user feedback and make necessary adjustments.
o	Deploy final version on chosen hosting solution.
